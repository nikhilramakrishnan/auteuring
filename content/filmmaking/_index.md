## Experience

#### Full Circle

This is a story about a boy with a moral dilemma who is determined to put things right, after a scarring incident with a kindly record store owner. 
A love for music is the throughline. 

I was: Writer, Script Supervisor

### Editing projects

#### Biddu Appaiah: A Brief History
This is a mini documentary about a legend of disco music that not many people might know about. I wrote the script for it after doing research across various sources. The voice is generated. Forgive the occasionally incorrect captions.

#### Ominous
Stock footage, but bespoke sound, composed by me, to evoke the sense of dread.

#### Solace

The idea was to capture the calm associated with visiting a coffee shop.
It was also supposed to be an advertisement for the shop. 
I do not think it serves very well as an ad, but it was an attempt at capturing an experience.

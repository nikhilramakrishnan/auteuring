# engineering

Software engineer based in San Francisco. I like building things that solve real problems.

Started with music, found my way to code. Both scratch the same creative itch - making something from nothing.

[2024-05-29 18:42:16] USER: "i want to host my own music files"
[2024-05-29 18:42:17] CLAUDE: oh no, here we go...

[2024-05-29 19:15:32] explored 47 different hosting options
[2024-05-29 19:32:44] learned about ddos billing horror stories
[2024-05-29 19:45:21] pivoted to backblaze (spending caps ftw)
[2024-05-29 20:03:17] realized static sites can't do real auth
[2024-05-29 20:04:02] accepted our limitations like adults

[2024-05-29 20:45:11] achievements unlocked:
- removed that weird docs/ folder thing
- lowercase everything (aesthetic > convention)  
- built a collection page that actually works
- host files at tracks.auteur.ing without going broke
- kept the whole thing stupidly simple

[2024-05-29 21:32:55] final thought: we started wanting one thing
(self-hosted music empire) and ended up with something better 
(a site that just works). sometimes the best engineering is 
knowing when to stop engineering.

[2024-05-29 21:33:02] pushing to main...
[2024-05-29 21:33:04] done. going to sleep mode.

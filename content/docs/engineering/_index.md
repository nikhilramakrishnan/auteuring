# Engineering

I've been building software for a while now, and it's taken me through different cities, companies, and countless late nights debugging things that shouldn't have broken in the first place.

Currently I'm at Uber in San Francisco, working on things that help millions of people get around. Before this, I've bounced between Toronto and the Bay Area, picking up different perspectives on how to build things that matter.

My journey into tech wasn't always obvious - I actually started with a deep love for music and creative expression. But I found that coding scratched a similar itch: the desire to create something from nothing, to solve problems in elegant ways, and occasionally, to make something that just feels right.

## Languages & Tools

I'm comfortable in multiple languages - both programming and human. Tamil and English are my native tongues, and I've picked up Java, Android development, and whatever else was needed to ship the right solution.

## Philosophy

I believe in being detailed and persistent. Quick ramp-ups are just part of the job - you learn what you need to learn to get things done. The best code is the code that solves real problems for real people.

I'm not one for listing every framework or technology I've touched. If you're curious about specific technical details, let's have a conversation. I'm more interested in the problems we're solving than the tools we're using to solve them.

My roots in DJing were born from a love of music. I stumbled across drum and bass and obsessed about learning how to DJ. Some music left more of an impact on me than others: 

- A.R Rahman
- Pink Floyd
- Tamil songs
- Metal (death, nu, etc), alt rock.
- R&B
- Rap & hip-hop
- Old school house music
- Early Daft Punk
- 90s jungle music
- Noisia, Rockwell, DJ Hazard
- Ilayaraja
- Gqom music (e.g DJ Lag)
- south african house music
- metal bands from india, bengaluru (pre-2010 inner sanctum)
- pendulum
- skeptical, dbridge
- amapiano
- royksopp
